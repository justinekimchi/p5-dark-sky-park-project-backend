            'Big Bend Ranch State Park is a ~355,000 acres state park in the “Trans-Pecos” region of far west Texas, U.S. It extends along the U.S.-Mexico border from southeast of Presidio to near Lajitas, in both Brewster and Presidio counties. It is situated adjacent to Big Bend National Park, which was designated an International Dark Sky Park in 2012. The geographic setting of Big Bend Ranch is extremely remote and rugged, such that the area has been referred to in Spanish as El Despoblado (“the uninhabited”). At one time among the 15 largest working cattle ranches in the United States and described as ‘half the size of Rhode Island’, Big Bend Ranch was purchased by the State of Texas in 1988 and opened to the public on a limited basis three years later. It is now a regional attraction for enthusiasts of camping, hiking, off-road driving, bird watching photography, boating, fishing and other outdoor pursuits. Since the Big Bend National Park IDSP designation, those recreational activities have expanded to include stargazing. With very little in the way of outdoor lighting and its location in the same large ‘pool’ of natural darkness encompassing the national park, Big Bend Ranch is a somewhat more accessible outlet for visitors seeking some of the darkest night skies in the lower 48 U.S. states. The Park seeks to educate visitors, with a steadily increasing offering of nighttime programs, and has made an impressive effort to reach out beyond the Park boundaries to the communities whose lighting choices impact its night skies. In June 2020, Big Bend Ranch State Park announced the inclusion of the Chinati Mountains State Natural Area (CMSNA) into their existing International Dark Sky Park designation. The addition of CMSNA added approximately 40,000 acres of rugged and remote Chihuahuan Desert to the existing BBRSP Dark Sky Park designation. Together, with neighboring Big Bend National Park, this region of the Big Bend is one of the largest areas of protected night sky in the United States.',

The Preserve is bordered by the wet freshwater prairie of Everglades National Park to the south, and other federal and State of Florida lands to the west. The Park’s human prehistory stretches back thousands of years, and it was occupied historically by a number of Native American tribes through the nineteenth century, when the Seminole Indians were removed from the land. Big Cypress is a center of biodiversity, hosting a variety of species including orchids, cypresses, mangroves, venomous snakes, birds, the Florida black bear and the elusive Florida panther. Together with nearby Everglades National Park, Big Cypress is an important bulwark against land development in south Florida, representing some of the last dark territory in the region. Still, it is impacted by light from the Miami and Naples/Fort Meyers metro areas. Preserve staff have recognized the value of the dark buffer that Big Cypress and Everglades place between these cities as it applies to their overall conservation mission, and have taken concrete steps to protect the resource and raise its awareness among visitors.',

At its heart is the Black Canyon, a steep-walled, chasm formed by the Gunnison River as it carved its way through nearly 700 meters’ worth of Precambrian schist and gneiss deposits. The feature takes its name from the near-permanent shadowing of the river bottom due to the strong vertical relief of the canyon walls. The Park is composed largely of federal lands and private property used for agricultural production, helping preserve its dark skies against long-term urban encroachment. There is little artificial light at night on the property, and the fixtures that exist are 100% compliant with the Park’s lighting plan. Regular interpretive programming stresses the value of dark skies and their appreciation at the Canyon, and the Park has worked with a local amateur astronomy society since 1998 to put on nighttime events engaging thousands of visitors every year.',

Its domes and cliffs of white Navajo Sandstone define the park’s landscape and reminded early visitors of the dome of the United States Capitol building. Despite serving over 830,000 visitors in 2014, Capitol Reef has largely resisted infrastructure development and instead offers visitors a rustic experience.

The cone rises steeply from the surrounding grassland to an elevation of 2,494 m above sea level. Its irregular rim is about a 2 km in circumference, and the bottom is about 120 m below the rim. From the rim, visitors have unobstructed, panoramic views of the volcanic field, distant snow-capped mountains, and portions of four states (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado). The Park is situated in one of the darker locations in the lower 48 U.S. states, and as a result it presents night skies that are nearly pristine under typical conditions. The surrounding topography is extremely irregular, consisting of approximately 120 volcanoes and numerous mesas and buttes that rise as high as 600 m above the surrounding plains and stretch from 2 to 22 km. These landforms not only discourage development, but serve as natural screens for distant sources of light on the horizon. Park staff are increasingly knowledgeable about the value of the dark-sky resource there, and present larger numbers of night skies interpretive programs with each passing year. Outreach efforts are underway to communicate the value of dark night skies to residents of sparsely-populated nearby communities.',

A natural amphitheater, the Park is famous for its brilliantly-colored geological formations resulting from uplift and erosion of sediments deposited in a lake environment some 60 million years ago. Erosional processes applied to relatively soft shale, limestone and sandstone have resulted in the formation of pinnacles known as ‘hoodoos’ that give the landscape at Cedar Breaks its distinct appearance. Its National Monument designation protects both these landforms as well as a number of threatened or endangered species and evidence of 10,000 years of human presence and occupation in the area. The Park is situated in one of the largest regions of remaining natural darkness in the lower 48 U.S. states. Along with other U.S. National Parks and Monuments on the Colorado Plateau – some of which are already designated IDA International Dark Sky Parks – Cedar Breaks is developing into a mecca for astrotourism. The Park’s leadership have seized on this opportunity to provide an expanding array of education and outreach opportunities to both visitors and residents of communities across southern Utah. The message is simple: Cedar Breaks is in possession of a fragile and vanishing natural resource, and the Park will make every effort to help preserve it. With few resources, proportional to its small visitor base, the Park has done commendable work to that end.',

            'Craters Of The Moon National Monument protects some 21,618 hectares of volcanic formations and lava flows on the northern edge of the Snake River Plain in south-central Idaho, U.S. A sequence of eruptions in the area from roughly 15,000 to 2,000 years ago resulted from rifting of the surface due to residual heat from the Yellowstone hotspot, thought to have been located under what is now Craters Of The Moon some 10 to 11 million years ago. Repeated lava flows raised the land elevation enough to expose it to prevailing southwesterly winds, helping to keep the area dry. As a result, there is very little vegetation on the lava fields, giving the area the sense of desolation. Upon signing his executive order creating the Monument in 1924, U.S. President Calvin Coolidge succinctly described it: ‘this area contains many curious and unusual phenomena of great educational value and has a weird and scenic landscape peculiar to itself.’ The Monument sits at the edge of one of the largest remaining ‘pools’ of natural nighttime darkness in the lower 48 U.S. states, defined by the rugged wilderness of interior Idaho. Forbidding conditions on the Snake River Plain deterred settlers in historic times, and the area remains sparsely populated. This also serves as a form of natural defense against development that could bring significant new sources of artificial light at night; most larger cities in Idaho roughly follow the course of the Snake River as it sweeps a wide arc through the southern half of the state. Craters Of The Moon has capitalized its dark-sky resource – as well as its planetary-themed name – to draw visitor attention to the splendor of its night skies and their active conservation.',

Its name derives from the park lands’ use as a natural corral by cowboys in the nineteenth century. At an elevation of 1,800 meters (5,900 feet) above sea level, its dry, high desert climate makes for challenging conditions for the survival of local flora and fauna. In addition to several overlooks, the park features a visitor center, a campground with 21 individual campsites and one group campsite, a picnic area, and a 14-kilometer (9-mile) loop hiking trail. The park area is best known for its use in the iconic final ‘Grand Canyon’ scene of the 1991 film Thelma & Louise. The park’s situation on the relatively undeveloped Colorado Plateau, and over 48 km (30 mi.) from Moab – the nearest populated place of any consequence – renders it almost as dark as Canyonlands International Dark Sky Park. Furthermore, its position above the canyon walls makes for spectacular, virtually unobstructed, viewing of the night sky with sweeping, 360-degree panoramas. Building on the success at Canyonlands, the park has partnered with the U.S. National Park Service to host evening dark-skies programming for visitors.

The structures, known locally as ‘goblins’, take on a variety of fantastical shapes and stand as high as several meters. Along with Bryce Canyon National Park, 300 kilometers (185 miles) to the southwest, Goblin Valley has some of the highest densities of hoodoos anywhere in the world. The Park’s location in a remote corner of the Colorado Plateau and away from major urban centers yields a dark-sky resource that is comparable in quality to several Gold-tier IDA Dark Sky Parks in the region, such as Natural Bridges National Monument, Capitol Reef National Park, and Canyonlands National Park. Goblin Valley attracts far fewer visitors than its higher-profile neighbors, but those who choose to visit this out-of-the-way gem are rewarded with nighttime views of the same spectacular skies and much smaller crowds. Park leadership and staff have committed to preserving the quality of local night skies and have developed a modest but effective outreach program that draws visitor attention to the fact that ‘half the park is after dark.',

The canyon is an enormous natural structure standing up to 29 kilometers (18 miles) wide and almost 2 kilometers (1 mile) in depth. Given the Grand Canyon’s remarkably dark night skies and U.S. National Park Service (NPS) efforts to make visitors aware that ‘half the park is after dark,’ an authentic and meaningful dark-skies experience is available to over 6 million visitors annually. The Park is situated in some of the most remote and rugged territory left in the lower 48 U.S. states; this landscape thwarted most historical attempts at development and has left the Canyon’s surroundings largely unpopulated. However, its historically high rate of visitation left a legacy of over 5,000 light fixtures in the Park. 2016 the park was awarded  Provisional International Dark Sky Park status and the NPS and the Grand Canyon Association embarked on a multi-year effort to bring all of those fixtures into compliance with IDA requirements. In June of 2019, Grand Canyon National Park completed this project and was awarded full status in time for the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the National Park.',

It protects crucial habitat for endemic species and hundreds of archaeological and historic sites. With respect to dark skies, the Park is in a virtually unique setting sandwiched between the ‘Inland Empire’ metropolitan area of some 4 million inhabitants near its western edge, and the last pool of natural darkness remaining in Southern California in its eastern extremity. For residents of the greater Los Angeles area – some 18 million people as of 2015 – Joshua Tree National Park is the nearest convenient place to go stargazing under a relatively dark sky. While the western half of the Park is significant impacted by light from Palm Springs and, to a lesser extent, the cities of the nearby Morongo Basin, visitors who make the trek to the Park’s eastern wilderness area are rewarded with some of the darkest night skies left in the region. With the rise of an astrotourism base, the Park has taken an increasingly active role in preserving what darkness remains. Its own house is in good order, the result of a lack of utility-provided electricity within the Park boundaries to power outdoor lighting and a reliance on solar photovoltaic systems. It has made some headway in influencing neighboring jurisdictions, including pressing successfully for major improvements to the lighting ordinance in surrounding San Bernardino County. The Park has also supported efforts to update lighting codes in the cities of Twentynine Palms and Yucca Valley, and it convinced a nearby military base to substantially reduce its use of outdoor light at night. The Park maintains a program of education and outreach to its visitors, impressing on them both the value of natural darkness and the ways that careless use of artificial light at night harms the nighttime environment.',

            'Petrified Forest National Park  is a 594.6 km2 (146,930-acre) IUCN Category II site located in northeastern Arizona, U.S. The Park preserves a landscape dominated by semi-desert shrub steppe and a series of colorful, highly eroded badlands. Its name refers to the presence of many well-preserved trunks of trees that grew in a humid and subtropical forest near the edge of the supercontinent Pangaea during the Late Triassic period of the Mesozoic era, about 225 million years ago. Downed trees were quickly covered by sediment washing out of mountains in the continent’s interior, creating anoxic conditions that promoted fossilization among alternating layers of mudstone, silt- stone, and claystone. Because the colorful, mineralized interiors of the trunks are highly valued when cut and polished, protection of the site from destructive fossil hunting became a priority in the early twentieth century, leading to its establishment first as a U.S. National Monument in 1906 and a National Park in 1962. In addition to preserving its geological resources, the Park also boasts many kilometers of trails for hiking and mountain biking, and visitors enjoy other activities such as photography and wildlife viewing. Given its location in a rural area of Arizona, and that roughly half of its territory is designated wilderness, Petrified Forest is increasingly recognized as a valuable reservoir of nighttime darkness. In the last decade, the Park began offering nighttime programming highlighting the value of the night sky to wildlife and other natural resources; more recently, outreach has directly addressed the issue of light pollution and external impacts to the Park’s night skies. Further, the Park has begun to remedy problematic outdoor lighting in order to better serve as an example of proper lighting practices. Designation as an International Dark Sky Park not only recognizes the Park’s efforts to protect its nighttime resources, but complements the value of other International Dark Sky Places in northern Arizona that keep pressure on governments from the municipal to state levels in pursuing policies that promote preservation of dark night skies across the region.',

The Park’s situation at 1,700 meters (5,500 feet) elevation near the foot of the Uinta Mountains brings an arid climate with hot summers and cold winters. Well-known to naturalists and fossil hunters, the area brims with a large diversity of plant and animal species. Steinaker’s location makes it a popular base for exploring both Dinosaur National Monument to the east and the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area to the north. The Park’s remote location in a little-developed part of the state of Utah has kept its night skies relatively dark. The nearest significant source of light, Vernal, is effectively screened by topography to the Park’s south. Besides a small light dome from the town of Dinosaur, Colorado, to the Park’s east, much of its horizon is protected by an expanse of the Ashley National Forest to the north and west. This makes Steinaker a relatively defensible location that is readily accessible to the public at night.

Mission San José de Tumacácori and Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi were established in 1691 by Father Eusebio Kino (1645-1711), a Jesuit priest. The third mission protected by the park, Mission San Cayetano de Calabazas, was established nearby in 1756. According to the park website, Tumacácori ‘sits at a cultural crossroads in the Santa Cruz River valley. Here O’odham, Yaqui, and Apache people met and mingled with European Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries, settlers, and soldiers, sometimes in conflict and sometimes in cooperation.’ After experiencing a decline in the early nineteenth century and in significant disrepair, the missions were abandoned by 1848. It is an important site in the history of the Spanish colonization of what is now the southwestern United States. Since 2016, the Park has conducted a number of evening programs intended to draw visitors’ attention to the night sky over Tumacácori in the context of natural darkness as a cultural resource. This is similar to the interpretive strategy at Chaco Culture National Historical Park, which became an IDA International Dark Sky Park in 2013. In addition to expanding the palette of visitor offerings at a Park whose focus is not on natural resources, the staff at Tumacácori use night skies as a means of conveying a sense of what the Southwest was like in the time when the first Spanish missionaries arrived in the seventeenth century. Despite its situation almost midway between two growing urban centers in southern Arizona, Tumacácori retains a remarkably dark sky that helps evince in visitors a sense of what night skies of the past looked like.',
